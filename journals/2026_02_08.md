	- >Normal people think that the purpose of a university is to research new knowledge and educate the next generation.
	  What universities actually do, however, is publish papers nobody reads in journals nobody can afford, in order to make their numbers go up in ranking systems nobody understands, so they can attract research funding and student enrollments so they can pay people to publish more academic papers.

	      Passive Voice: It began mimicking my tendency to use passive phrasing when I'm tired.
	      The Echo Chamber: Instead of suggesting the strong, direct phrase "Checking in on this," it would offer my usual, weaker "Just wanted to check in."
	- >writing is different. When you are drafting an email or an article, you want to be the best, clearest version of yourself. You don't want an AI that simply mirrors your existing flaws.
