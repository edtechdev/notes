	- **Imperative**, adrenaline mood: (fear, extrinsic motivation, etc)
		- >While effective for urgent tasks or memorizing isolated items, this state may hinder a student's ability to understand how facts relate to one another or to apply knowledge flexibly in new situations
		- Ignores context, resulting in lack of transfer, inert knowledge
		- >A classroom driven entirely by high-stakes testing may compromise deep understanding
		- >Imperative (Commanding): Focuses on "exploitation"—using current knowledge to execute an immediate, urgent action (e.g., fleeing or passing a test). This roughly correlates with avoidance or high-stakes extrinsic motivation.
	- **Interrogative**, dopamine mood: (curiosity, intrinsic motivation or low pressure extrinsic rewards)
		- >This mood facilitates relational memories and the formation of schemas (mental maps). It prioritizes connecting new information to existing knowledge
		- >This state supports deep conceptual understanding, inference, and the ability to generalize learning to the future, though it may result in less precision regarding specific details
		- >Interrogative (Querying): Focuses on "exploration"—gathering information to build maps for the future. This correlates with intrinsic curiosity but also low-pressure extrinsic reward seeking.
	- Framing, transparent teaching
		- >Narrative Framing: How a learning goal is framed matters. Instructions such as "You need to learn this because it will be tested" versus "You need to learn this because you will need to do it again" can induce different motivational states, biasing students toward either immediate exploitation of facts or flexible exploration
