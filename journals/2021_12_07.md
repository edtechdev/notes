	- >“Listening theater” is when a manager appears to be seeking out feedback from their staff, but none of that feedback is ever taken seriously or used. #quote
	- >Employee [[voice]] (an employee’s willingness to speak up about things) has been shown to be a critical element of successful [[workplace]] functioning in study after study.
	- >The manager may actually care about the points of view of their staff, but not more than their need to be in control
	- >A good manager can’t white-knuckle the work; they have to trust in and empower their staff.
	- >We’ve got to let go of the idea of manager as “boss.”
	- >Before asking for feedback, consider why you want to do that and how you plan to use what you learn. If you don’t have any plan for actually using the feedback, don’t ask for it. There is nothing worse than taking the time to thoughtfully provide feedback on something only to be completely ignored.
	- >A manager who is really concerned with diversity, equity, and inclusion knows that making progress on this work requires empowering and giving voice to those with the least power in the organization. But in places with fearful or autocratic management, you sometimes see the (often White) people at the top running DEI work and deciding how that learning and engagement will trickle down to the (often more diverse) staff, some of whom may actually even have experience with this sort of work in other settings.
	- >“Listening theater” feels like gaslighting. In the moment, you might really feel like you’re being heard, but when your manager never takes action on anything you’ve discussed, you begin to feel like a ghost — like you’re talking to someone who literally doesn’t see or hear you. You question yourself — are your suggestions terrible? Really stupid? Is your manager just humoring you in the moment? Maybe there’s something wrong with you. You start to feel too embarrassed to bring things up (because clearly your ideas are truly awful).

	- >[[Gatekeeping]]: Fisher acted as a gatekeeper for the profession of statistics, encouraging what he considered to be the right types to enter, and as his words make clear, he considered the right type of statistician to be one most like himself.
	- >Pretending to answer them under a veil of [[objectivity]] serves to dehumanize our colleagues
	- >In the 1972 book [[Social Science]]s as Sorcery, Stanislav Andreski argued that, in their search for [[objectivity]], researchers had settled for a cheap version of it, hiding behind statistical methods as “quantitative camouflage.” Instead, we should strive for the moral objectivity we need to simultaneously live in the world and study it. #quote
	- >a scientific hypothesis is never just a statistical hypothesis—that two means in the population are different, that two variables are correlated, that a treatment has some nonzero effect—but an attempt at explaining why, by how much, and why it matters. The fact that significance testing ignores this is what economists Deirdre McCloskey and Stephen Ziliak in their 2008 book The Cult of [[Statistical Significance]] called the “sizeless stare of statistical significance.” As they put it, “Statistical significance is not a scientific test. It is a philosophical, qualitative test. It does not ask how much. It asks ‘whether,’ ”—as in, whether an effect or association simply exists. “Existence, the question of whether, is interesting,” they said, “but it is not scientific.”
	- >In the context of eugenics, it’s understandable why Galton, Pearson, and Fisher would care so much about questions of existence. For the purposes of eugenic discrimination, it was enough to state that distinct racial subgroups existed or there was a “significant” correlation between intelligence and cleanliness or a “significant” difference in criminality, fertility, or disease incidence between people of different socioeconomic classes. The first hypotheses were taxonomic: whether individuals could be considered to be of the same species, or whether people were of the same race. The separation was everything—not how much, what else might explain it, or why it mattered, just that it was there. Significance testing did not spring fully formed from the heads of these men. It was crafted and refined over the years specifically to articulate evolutionary and eugenicist arguments. Galton, Pearson, and Fisher the eugenicists needed a quantitative way to argue for the existence of such differences, and Galton, Pearson, and Fisher the statisticians answered the call with significance testing.
