	- >dopamine is more closely related to the anticipation of a reward than to its receipt. Dopamine causes the wanting of something and the motivation to go and get it, not the enjoyment of it.
	- >Dopamine is also essential for learning. In this context, the key element that causes dopamine neurons to fire is surprise, regardless of whether the outcome is rewarding or disappointing.
	- >Dopamine tells you not when something is good or bad, per se, but when it’s better or worse than you expected it to be,” Dr. Lerner said. That surge of dopamine helps you update your expectations and potentially modify your behavior for the future
