	- >While respondents described high-level knowledge and compelling delivery of the subject matter, effective class design and use of technology, and good stagecraft on behalf of the instructor as important aspects of effective lecture-style teaching, a substantial proportion of students mentioned interaction as the most important component of an effective lecture style class, suggesting that student preferences for passive classrooms is far from universal.

	- >In this paper, we introduce an alternative asynchronous approach that allows the collaborative portion to be completed unsupervised and outside of regular class hours, within 48 hr of the individual exam. This method not only eases logistical constraints but also allows more time for collaboration, potentially enhancing feedback quality. Our findings show that students equate their engagement, collaboration, and feedback quality during the asynchronous collaborative exam with that of standard in-class exams and show signs of retention of learning. This cost-effective approach requires no extra time or resources and could promote widespread adoption of this effective assessment method, especially in online-only and general STEM courses.
