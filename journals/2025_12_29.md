	- >Every dollar committed to LMS extensions—analytics platforms, predictive tools, engagement modules—is a dollar not spent on what actually advances learning: faculty innovation, curriculum design, program-level experimentation, and institutional capacity to shape its own tools.
	- >Over time, institutions thus find themselves allocating a growing share of their learning budgets to a platform that, at its core, was never designed to support learning. The result is an expanding cost center focused on technology and is, at best, marginal to pedagogy.
	- [Is the LMS Now a Commodity? - by Alfred Essa](https://ailearninsights.substack.com/p/is-the-lms-now-a-commodity)
	- >For them, the LMS is not primarily a pedagogical system; it is a distribution layer meant to create lock-in. If institutions cannot clearly articulate what an LMS must do‚ and what it does not need to do, they risk ceding control of core learning infrastructure and capability to external platforms whose incentives are, at best, only loosely aligned with education. In doing so, institutions would not merely adopt new tools—they would strategically outsource a core educational capability to external actors.

	- >We argue that this creates a structural condition, Epistemia:
	  linguistic plausibility substitutes for epistemic evaluation, producing the *feeling of knowing without actually knowing*.
	  To address Epistemia, we propose three complementary strategies: epistemic evaluation, epistemic governance, and epistemic literacy.

	- >AI hasn’t killed assessment. It has killed lazy assessment
	- >The purpose of assessment is to provide just-in-time feedback — ongoing, specific, diagnostic, corrective feedback that guides learning as it is occurring. Assessment, in this view, is not the endpoint. Its purpose is not judgment and ranking. It is the process of accumulating evidence in order to determine how the student and the instructor should move learning forward.
	- >what evidence do we need in order to help this learner move forward in their learning at this moment in time? That question applies equally to learners who are struggling and to those who are doing well.
