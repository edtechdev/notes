	- >Placing students on academic probation based on overall GPA reduced their chances of four-year graduation by 40 percent.
	  Academic probation based on early overall GPA cut students’ four-year graduation rate in half.
	  Probation based on semester GPA reduced the chances of graduating in four years by about two-thirds. In other words, if a student was very close to the semester GPA cutoff but not placed on academic probation, then they were three times more likely to graduate on time than if they were placed on probation.
