	- >The premortem technique was invented by Gary Klein in response to some of these decision-making challenges. It asks participants to adopt the assumption that whatever they’re trying to do has failed at some time in the future. It’s the opposite of a postmortem analysis of what went wrong. A premortem assumes it failed ahead of time and asks “why?” There is no risk of airing concerns anymore because failure is assumed, and the process collects individual ideas before discussion to reduce bias from culture or personalities. A premortem forces a decision process where one might otherwise be avoided, and it can mitigate against the bull-rush tactics of overinvested people.
