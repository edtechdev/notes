	- >Nearly 1.5 million U.S. undergraduates take an Introductory Statistics course each year. One third of these students—nearly 500,000—do not do well enough to earn credit for the course. Among those who identify as Black or Latinx and students from low-income backgrounds, the risk of not earning a course credit is even higher. An estimated 4 out of every 10 Black students enrolling in an Introductory Statistics course, for example, fail, withdraw, or take an Incomplete.
