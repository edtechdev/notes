	- >There is also a broader data concern with AI browsers: many rely on cloud-based LLM APIs to function. This means that page content or user prompts are sent to remote servers for processing. If users feed sensitive internal documents or personal data to the browser's AI, that data could reside on an external server and potentially be logged or used to further train models (unless opt-out mechanisms are in place).

When observing human movements, the avenues researching these phenomena are specialized processor and signaling. Lastly, the research avenue social cognition is integral to both making and observing human movements.
