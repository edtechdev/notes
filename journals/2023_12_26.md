	- **Two complementary mechanisms:** [[Gemini]] [[Summary]]
		- **Structuring:** This mechanism aims to break down complex tasks into manageable steps, providing guidance and resources to help students navigate the learning process. This could involve prompts, templates, checklists, or step-by-step instructions.
		- **Problematizing:** This mechanism introduces critical questions, challenges, and opportunities for reflection within the learning activity. It pushes students to analyze information, consider diverse perspectives, and grapple with the complexities of the subject matter. This might involve open-ended prompts, simulations, debates, or tasks that require critical thinking and synthesis.
	- **Designing effective experiences:**
		- **Balance the two mechanisms:** Striking a balance between structuring and problematizing is crucial. Over-structuring can lead to spoon-feeding information and hindering independent thinking, while over-problematizing can overwhelm students and leave them lost without guidance. Consider the level of complexity and prior knowledge of your learners when adjusting the balance.
		- **Focus on key disciplinary content and strategies:** The scaffolded activities should not only guide students through the task but also expose them to essential concepts, methods, and thinking skills within the specific discipline.
		- **Encourage reflection and metacognition:** Incorporate opportunities for students to reflect on their learning process, their understanding of the subject, and the effectiveness of the scaffolding itself. This helps them become more independent learners and develop self-regulation skills.
		- **Consider the classroom context:** Remember that scaffolding is part of a larger system of supports within the classroom. Think about how the designed learning experiences might fit into the overall curriculum, classroom culture, and teacher instruction.
	- **Additional points:**
		- The article emphasizes the use of software tools for scaffolding complex learning, but the principles can be applied to various learning settings and activities, even ones without technology.
		- The article acknowledges the tension between making tasks easier through structuring and pushing students to engage with complexity through problematizing. Finding the right balance will depend on the specific learning goals and context.
	- By understanding and applying the concepts presented in "Scaffolding Complex Learning," educators can design learning experiences that are both challenging and supportive, leading to deeper understanding and meaningful learning outcomes for students.

	- >This study also revealed new limitations in the design capabilities of ChatGPT. Specifically, lessons are designed as standalone units of information. Unlike human educators, AI lacks the ability to integrate prior lessons with current learning experiences or strategically prepare students for future learning outcomes
