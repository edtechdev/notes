		- >The panic isn’t because learning isn’t happening.
		  It’s because the sacrifice isn’t happening.
		- >We couldn’t separate “learning” from “struggling alone with difficult material.”
		  They seemed like the same thing.
		  You had to struggle—to somehow prove your mettle—to learn.
		  So that struggle (and not the productive kind) just became synonymous with learning.
		  Then, inconveniently. Quite inconveniently . . .
		  AI revealed the truth:
		  manufactured struggle was never essential to learning,
		  but it was essential to selection.
		- >The students who couldn’t struggle effectively—or who thought that the system was actually about learning—failed.
		  And AI threatens to help those students.
