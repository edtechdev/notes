	- >LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini which are among the most widely accessible to teachers, do not come preloaded with the depth of pedagogical theory needed to design truly effective activities; second, although sophisticated prompt engineering can bridge this gap, most teachers lack the time or expertise and find it difficult to encode such pedagogical nuance into their requests.
	- >We embed the well-established Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework into a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to act as a sophisticated instructional designer.
	- >Teachers strongly preferred the activities from the collaborative MAS-CMD, describing them as significantly more creative, contextually relevant, and classroom-ready.
	- >Teachers did not just rate the MAS-CMD outputs higher; they articulated why. Their praise centered on specific, high-value attributes that the rubric may not fully weigh: creativity (“so creative,” “fantastic idea”), deep contextual relevance (the “urban planning theme makes the geometry meaningful”), and, crucially, teacher-centric utility (the inclusion of a “worksheet and exit ticket” was “Super helpful”).
	- >LLMs are known to exhibit systematic biases, including a preference for longer outputs, a tendency to favor the first option in a comparison, and a potential preference for outputs generated by models from the same developer family
	- >the LLM judge reached a “ceiling effect” on several criteria, such as Foundational Alignment and Inclusivity, where all systems scored near the maximum, limiting the rubric’s ability to differentiate the outputs meaningfully
	- >The key contribution is showing that embedding learning science principles directly into AI architectures is an effective way to produce pedagogically sound materials. This approach bridges the “prompting gap,” shifting AI from a content generator to a pedagogical partner. Findings also highlight that MAS architecture matters: a collaborative, discussion-based model outperformed a sequential one in producing innovative, coherent designs.

- >Multiple agents work collaboratively to facilitate the entire process of course design, instruction, and management. The interface agents in MAIC system include teacher and student agents, while the back-end agents consist of analytical agents such as the Classroom Situation Analysis Agent, Learning Situation Analysis Agent, and Classroom Director Agent. For course design the instructors upload relevant course materials, and the agents utilize a range of models such as
  multimodal understanding and knowledge structure extraction to draft teaching slides and lecture scripts. The instructor could further collaborate with agents to optimize the slides and scripts. Once the preparation is completed, the course is conducted by AI teaching agents which utilize highly human-like natural speech, closely mimicking the tone and delivery of real classroom teacher. Students listened the lecture while interacting with multiple AI peers. Four types of AI peers are designed to provide students with a more simulated learning environment-- Sparker, Questioner, Thinker and Notetaker

	      work that seems pointless per se and feels unsatisfying, a hoop to jump through in order to get to an extrinsic reward like a good grade or a diploma;
	      a sense of do-or-die urgency, because the stakes of success or failure are high, because the work must be done very quickly, and/or parents or others are putting a lot of pressure on the learner not to fail;
	      a perception that others are cheating all the time so it's normalized;
	      or a lack of confidence in one's own ability to do the assignment, or that their own work has value (i.e. self-efficacy).
