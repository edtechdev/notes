- [Hamel Husain (@HamelHusain): "For over a year, @jeremyphoward has been in stealth mode. In this exclusive talk, he showcases what he's been working on. He & @johnowhitaker show us SolveIt, a new dev environment and programming paradigm. ðŸ¤¯ Imagine this workflow: - Build a web app & interact with its UI on the same screen as your code. No more flipping to a separate browser. - Use live variables from your REPL directly in prompts to the AI. The AI knows your current state. - Turn any Python function into an AI tool instantly. No no registering tools or MCP. Just write a function in a cell and tell the AI to use it. This is a live, malleable environment that fuses the best ideas from Literate Programming (Knuth), the live-object world of Smalltalk, and the interactive cells of Jupyter. Who is Solveit for? Jeremy's take: SolveIt is best for programmers who are either very new (< 3 years) or very experienced (> 20 years). Why? Because developers in the middle (3-20 years) often have ingrained workflows and can find this different paradigm confronting. New devs are open-minded and build good habits from scratch, while veterans immediately recognize how this approach solves decades-old problems of complexity and state management. My Thoughts It's early days, but it is super cool. You get all the fun of trying a new programming language without learning new syntax (Python), because it will show you new patterns and ways of doing this. If you are wiling to climb the learning curve it is an extremely powerful tool that you can be productive with on real tasks like writing and coding. I'm personally addicted to it for several workflows and am afraid of losing it tbh. How Can You Try It?
