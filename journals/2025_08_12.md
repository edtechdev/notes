	- [üëã Jan (@jandotai): "Introducing Jan-v1: 4B model for web search, an open-source alternative to Perplexity Pro. In our evals, Jan v1 delivers 91% SimpleQA accuracy, slightly outperforming Perplexity Pro while running fully locally. Use cases: - Web search - Deep Research Built on the new version of Qwen's Qwen3-4B-Thinking (up to 256k context length), fine-tuned for reasoning and tool use in Jan. You can run the model in Jan, llama.cpp, or vLLM. To enable search in Jan, go to Settings ‚Üí Experimental Features ‚Üí On, then Settings ‚Üí MCP Servers ‚Üí enable a search-related MCP such as Serper. Use the model: - Jan-v1-4B: https://huggingface.co/janhq/Jan-v1-4B - Jan-v1-4B-GGUF: https://huggingface.co/janhq/Jan-v1-4B-GGUF Credit to the @Alibaba_Qwen team for Qwen3 4B Thinking & @ggerganov for llama.cpp." | nitter](https://nitter.net/jandotai/status/1955176280535732415)
