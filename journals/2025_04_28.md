- [Shalini Goyal (@goyalshaliniuk): "Top 20 Agentic AI Concepts â€“ Explained in the Simplest Way ! If you're exploring AI agents, understanding these 20 foundational concepts will make everything easier! Here's a simple breakdown: 1. Agent: An AI that thinks, plans, and acts on its own to complete tasks. 2. LLM (Large Language Model): Acts as the agentâ€™s "brain" for understanding, reasoning, and generating human-like language. 3. Planning: The agent figures out a step-by-step path to solve a problem. 4. Memory: Helps agents remember facts, past actions, or conversationsâ€”like human memory! 5. Tool Use: Agents use external tools (APIs, calculators) to solve problems. 6. Task Decomposition: Breaks big tasks into smaller, manageable steps. 7. Self-Reflection: Agents review and improve their own work, finding mistakes. 8. Autonomous Execution: Agents complete tasks independently, without constant human help. 9. Context Window: The amount of information an agent can "see" and use at once. 10. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Fetches real facts before responding, not just guessing.
