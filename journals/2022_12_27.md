	- >We find ten classes of student involvement: academic artist, party 
	  athlete, serious athlete, conventional non-worker, disengaged, 
	  maximizer, moderate worker, detached partier, involved partier, and 
	  religious.
	- >Students reporting as first-generation or racially minoritized are 
	  overrepresented in the disengaged and involved partier classes.
	- >We find academic artists as the only class with a significant positive relationship across the seven dependent measures.
	- >The detached partier and party athlete classes have the lowest first-year GPAs of all latent classes.
