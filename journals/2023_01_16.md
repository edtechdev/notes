	- >To understand which universities exceed expectations and which lag behind, Yin created a formula that compares expected and actual graduation and retention rates given the institution’s characteristics. Interestingly, Yin’s risk-adjusted predictive model does not incorporate admission rates or standardized test scores.
	- >Albany State—where over 80 percent of the undergraduates receive Pell Grants—had a six-year graduation rate of 41 percent, despite a predicted rate of 24 percent. In stark contrast, Texas A&M Galveston, with just 22 percent Pell Grant students, had a 29 percent graduation rate, versus a predicted rate of 51 percent.
