	- >AI-only feedback and support seems most effective when tasks are low-stakes, tightly structured, and not identity-relevant: grammar correction, coding syntax, multiple-choice practice, drill exercises.
	- >AI for drills and drafts, humans for capstones, professional work, and emotionally difficult tasks. The boundary hinges on identity relevance and emotional stakes. When the work is “just practice,” AI is a useful tool.
	- >Stop assuming that delivering feedback is the same as learners learning from it. Start building tasks where learners must select the most important AI comments, write a revision plan, or identify where they disagree. Turn AI feedback into a prompt for thinking — not a to-do list.
