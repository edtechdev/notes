	- >In practice, many students lose the intuitive underpinnings of those abstractions and resort to memorizing rules of symbol manipulation which become cognitively arbitrary and severed from their intuitive grounding in embodied interactions. The current mathematical tools, workflow, and computational languages also favor symbol-based math and programming as one advances to later stages.
	- >novel framework for Computer Algebra in which sketching and embodied interactions are the main activities to generate and work with symbolic abstractions. The framework consists of three unique brushes (iconic element, list, and function) and two interactions (fused representations and abstraction layers).
	- > The embodied mathematics theory posits that our innate mathematical capabilities are limited to counting, categorizing and grouping
