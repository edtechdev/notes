	- >Instructors should initiate discussions with heuristic and interesting open-ended questions, gradually release control and give the central position to students and intervene only when necessary (eg, keep discussions on track, provide correct information, extend discussions, mediate conflicts, etc).
	- >Instructors should apply appropriate facilitation strategies (eg, establish detailed discussion rubrics, grade student posts and provide regular individual feedback).
	- >Instructors should use more instructional comments and supplement them with sincere rather than perfunctory social comments.
