	- >The bulk of the emerging L&D model—the 90%—is about re-coupling work and learning through AI-powered performance support. In practice, this means embedding support and “productive friction” within the workflow itself rather than locating it classrooms or LMSs.
	- >I already see a commitment to reducing investment in online courses and in person workshops, in favour of AI “copilots” integrated directly where work happens.
	- >In Teams/Slack channels, docs and CRMs, AI is on hand to help employees to draft artefacts, consider alternative approaches, weigh-up decisions and retrieve information from the organisation’s knowledge base using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
	- > L&D’s attention shifts from creating content about the work to designing the work itself. Success no longer looks like courses produced and completion rates but the extent to which learning happens drives both the velocity and quality of each employee’s work.

	- >the use of mandatory PD
	  programs has received considerable critical attention because it often does not suit teachers' needs (Ross & Bruce, 2007). It offers generic knowledge without further support for changing teachers’ practice (Cole et al., 2012), and it disregards teachers’ motivation and position as experienced learners (Hunzicker, 2010). Mandatory PD programs are also closely associated with an authoritarian perspective where experts deliver a set of knowledge (Rahman, 2016), assuming that teachers have the same
	  learning needs (Carlyon, 2015; Teng & Alonzo, 2023). It is often viewed as an ineffective series of activities imposed on teachers with minimum impact on their learning or classroom practices.

	- >Mandatory coercion often induces resentment and a close-minded, rebellious attitude toward the material presented. One can argue that making faculty development and similar activities, trainings, and workshops mandatory is a tacit admission that the activity is useless, unpleasant, a “box to be checked off for legal reasons,” and not anything that the captive audience would innately desire.
