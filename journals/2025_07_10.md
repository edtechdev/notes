- [Kyle Corbitt (@corbtt): "At OpenPipe we built an entire SFT platform before pivoting to RL. It's theoretically possible to get similar results with either approach. So why change? Compared to SFT, RL gets you: - Far better generalization from small datasets. With just 16 training examples you can get really strong results, and with 300 you're almost certainly not data-constrained. - Dataset examples are also much easier to generate -- you don't need golden answers in your dataset! - You're no longer constrained by the strength of a "teacher" model. We routinely train agents from small OSS models that are more reliable on their task than any frontier model! These difference add up and make RL a strong fit for many more tasks than SFT ever was." | nitter](https://nitter.net/corbtt/status/1942781788683726917)
