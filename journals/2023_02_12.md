	- >The notions of problem-solving or goal-oriented behaviour, being observerdependent descriptions, are shown to be irrelevant in this view, since intelligent behaviour results from a kind of interactions between organisms within a particular context.
	- >Although one can refer to intelligence as a phenomenon, because it is a configuration of relations between processes occurring during structural coupling, it is not directly observable and thus it cannot be measured.
	- >The IQ Test can, at most, estimate a subdomain of the domain of consensuality between the observer and the subject. No biological basis can be found for racial, social or educational discrimination, based on intelligence since the word ‘intelligence’ does not refer to a discrete individual attribute or property.
