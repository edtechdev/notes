	- >We begin from what it is the teacher has become and the terrors of performativity to re-envisage the educator as a genuine interlocutor and part of the fundamental encounter with the other as a concrete, palpable experience. An interlocutor who nurtures risk-taking and creates a public space that encourages fearless speech—that is a parrhesiatic pedagogy (Parrhesia is a mode of discourse in which people express their opinions and ideas candidly and honestly, avoiding the use of manipulation, rhetoric, or broad generalizations. In Foucault’s conception of parrhesia, frankness, truth, danger, criticism, and duty are all essential to understanding how such a verbal activity functions in relation to the speaker.), creating dialogic relations and discomfort in relation both to the context of crisis and what it is we have become as culpable humans. An education oriented to how not to be governed, a heterotopia a cultural, institutional, and discursive space that is somehow “other”: disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory, and transforming.
