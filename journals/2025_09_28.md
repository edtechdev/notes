	- >When a student asks, “What is Gradient Descent?”, the tutor doesn’t just give a definition — it retrieves an analogy like “Imagine finding the lowest point in a mountain valley by taking small steps downhill.”
	- >If a learner struggles with Decision Trees, the tutor can suggest a StatQuest video: “Here’s a fun breakdown by Josh that will help you visualize it better!”
	- >Before teaching Logistic Regression, make sure the student knows Linear Regression
