	- >AI mirrors human abilities, literally. In this new era, the most valuable technological skills for hybrid citizens will remain knowledge, critical thinking, and a quirky mind.
	- >Claude does not automatically "level up" a vague or simplistic request. If you give the model a high-school-level prompt, you receive a high-school-level response. If you provide a prompt rich in nuance, structured constraints, and graduate-level reasoning, the AI meets you there.
	- >This creates a “cognitive ceiling” effect. Two individuals, using the exact same version of the same model on the same day, will see radically different results. The differentiator is the human equipment of the operator.
	- >In philosophy: We must stop viewing AI as a "magic box" and start viewing it as a cognitive exoskeleton. An exoskeleton only moves as well as the person inside it. If the person is stationary, the suit does nothing.
	- >The better we become at being human, at communicating, at reasoning, and at envisioning, the more the mirror of AI will reflect back greatness. We cannot expect the technology of tomorrow to be better than the humans of today; the old saying "garbage in, garbage out" still holds true.
