### Research on Timed [[quizzes]]/[[tests]]:
	- Does giving students more time improve performance? These 2 references say no:
		- [Timed Online Tests: Do students perform better with more time](https://www.academia.edu/30122204/Timed_Online_Tests_Do_students_perform_better_with_more_time) #openaccess #reference
		- [Just Five More Minutes: The Relationship Between Timed and Untimed Performance on an Introductory Programming Exam](https://strategy.asee.org/just-five-more-minutes-the-relationship-between-timed-and-untimed-performance-on-an-introductory-programming-exam) #openaccess #reference
		- If that's the case more generally, I'd argue to give everyone 50% or whatever extra time instead of just those who request accommodations, as it doesn't seem like it would give anyone an unfair advantage. Alternatively if extra time isn't available for everyone, reduce exam content by a third.
	- Should we give students timed or untimed tests?
		- There's an overwhelming amount of research/opinion arguing against timed tests. It increases [[Anxiety]], [[Stress]], offers less [[Inclusion]], etc. Here are just 2 references:

		- [What Does the Research Say About Testing?](https://www.edutopia.org/article/what-does-research-say-about-testing)
			- >Research shows that simply introducing a time limit on a test can cause students to experience stress, so instead of emphasizing speed, teachers should encourage students to think deeply about the problems theyâ€™re solving.

	- >The results showed that formative assessment strategies were positively, albeit weakly, related to a growth mindset in the East, but not in the West. In contrast, growth mindset was positively related to reading achievement only in the West, but not in the East. The impacts of different formative assessment strategies on reading achievement demonstrated cross-cultural variability, but the strongest positive predictor was instructional adjustments.

	- >the more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor.
	- >Once scoring well on the test becomes the point, those tests lose their value as predictors of competence.
