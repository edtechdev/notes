	- >This is a crisis of human attention. Attention is the basis of concentration and of thinking; even more fundamentally, for Blackwell being human is grounded in “being attending and attentive beings, paying attention” (11). Platform AI is designed to consume our attention and harvest our data. It will continue to damage human agency, attention, and intelligence, Blackwell insists, unless at least two things happen.
	- >First, we must cultivate widespread engagement with technology through everyday programming: “The message of this book is that the world needs less AI, and better programming languages” (125). Escaping our AI dead end means more programming, not less, perhaps even popular or mass programming.
	  Second, we must organize widespread social means to learn everyday programming that is rooted in “MORAL CODES.” The first word is an acronym for More Open Representation for Accessible Learning
	- >“If computer users have access to appropriate notations—moral codes—they would also be able to use simple automation to spend the conscious hours of their lives in ways that are less mechanical, rather than more. If computer interfaces are designed as notational spaces, they offer freedom and negotiation, even forms of social organization, complex assemblies of intelligent decision making and deliberation, that respect the humans creating them, rather than pretending humans were not involved”
	- >An important objective of the mechanization was to measure both intellectual output and aptitude, a goal that led to intelligence testing and its legacy of objectifying racist hierarchy and white rule-making for the other peoples of the world.
	- >the word ‘intelligence’ itself was not used to refer to a measurable aptitude until this period of global racism. Cave draws attention to the worrying fact that, since the very idea of mechanically quantifiable intelligence is a racist project, the scientific ambition to replicate that mechanically quantifiable phenomenon in a computer—artificial intelligence—is nothing more or less than artificial racism”
	- >Blackwell agrees with the scholars who see AI systems as “racist by design,” in a world in which “racism itself is a kind of technology, invented to underpin the industrial processes and legacies of slavery”
