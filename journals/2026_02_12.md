	- >The Flower and Hayes model was explicitly recursive and non-linear. Yet it was received into educational practice as a sequential stage model: brainstorm, then organize, then draft, then revise—precisely the misrepresentation the researchers had warned against.
	- >Studying students in a community college remedial writing course, Perl found that writers constantly looped back, rereading what they had written, reconsidering their plans, starting new sentences before finishing old ones. The recursiveness was not a sign of dysfunction but of active engagement with the complexities of text production (Perl, 1979).
	- >When students internalize the staged model, they often experience writing as a series of obligatory performances rather than a recursive exploration. They produce outlines that don’t inform their drafts because the outline was written to satisfy an assignment, not to discover structure. They submit drafts that don’t benefit from revision because revision was conceived as a separate stage rather than an ongoing process.
	- >When AI can perform the staged process more efficiently than humans, the staged process stands revealed as something other than writing itself. It is a simulation of writing—a set of surface performances that can be executed without the underlying cognitive activity that makes writing valuable as a mode of thinking and learning.
