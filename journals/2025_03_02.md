	- >Our experiments show that annotators who frequently use LLMs for writing
	   tasks excel at detecting AI-generated text, even without any 
	  specialized training or feedback. In fact, the majority vote among five 
	  such "expert" annotators misclassifies only 1 of 300 articles, 
	  significantly outperforming most commercial and open-source detectors we
	   evaluated even in the presence of evasion tactics like paraphrasing and
	   humanization. Qualitative analysis of the experts' free-form 
	  explanations shows that while they rely heavily on specific lexical 
	  clues ('AI vocabulary'), they also pick up on more complex phenomena 
	  within the text (e.g., formality, originality, clarity) that are 
	  challenging to assess for automatic detectors.
