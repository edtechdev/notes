- [Simon (@tokumin): "NotebookLM shipped a new learning superpower this week, quietly: Tailored worksheet lessons I took a photo of a 4th grade completed worksheet with the new NotebookLM App camera and then made a custom Slide Deck: "Create a lesson that addresses each weakness in the students worksheet answers. do it in the style of minecraft". The results are just incredible. here are some samples - spot the easter egg feature :) I think this technique - "photo of worksheet, make me a lesson to help me understand it" has much promise, and I love how NLM brings the worksheet photo into the slides, crops in and things. woah! Would love to see if folks find it useful!" | nitter](https://nitter.net/tokumin/status/1997192562445050055#m)
