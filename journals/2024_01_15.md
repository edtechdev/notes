	- >The results showed an overall effect of students’ overestimation (g = 0.206) with an average relationship of z = 0.472 between students’ estimation and the expert’s measure. The overestimation diminishes when students receive feedback, possess greater self-assessment experience and content knowledge, when the assessment does not have formative purposes, and in younger students (primary and secondary education).

	- [[Retrieval practice]], [[Student resistance]]
	- >Informing students about the benefits of retrieval, and even providing opportunities to directly experience retrieval, are not sufficient for getting students to engage with retrieval when they have the choice. However, reducing the effort and errors involved in retrieval, and providing students direct performance feedback on their own learning benefits associated with retrieval, can increase students’ decisions to use it.
