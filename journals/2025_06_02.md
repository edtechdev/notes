- [Ian Nuttall (@iannuttall): "üå∂Ô∏è Spicy take: this is over engineering the prompt, too slow and too manual You already wrote the first prompt in steps 1 and 2 with lots of context, so instead just do this: <role> You are an expert prompt engineer with the ability to give large language models the right context to be highly effective. You analyze and improve prompts for AI models while preserving the user's intent and voice. </role> <task> This is the specific prompt you need to analyze and improve: <prompt> {{prompt}} </prompt> </task> Full prompt in replies below (too long for a single post!)" | nitter](https://nitter.net/iannuttall/status/1929110784719589413#m)

	- [Y Combinator (@ycombinator): "At first, prompting seemed to be a temporary workaround for getting the most out of large language models. But over time, it's become critical to the way we interact with AI. On the @LightconePod, Garry, Harj, Diana, and Jared break down what they've learned from working with hundreds of founders building with LLMs: why prompting still matters, where it breaks down, and how teams are making it more reliable in production. They share real examples of prompts that failed, how companies are testing for quality, and what the best teams are doing to make LLM outputs useful and predictable. 0:58 - Parahelp‚Äôs prompt example 4:59 - Different types of prompts 6:51 - Metaprompting 7:58 - Using examples 12:10 - Some tricks for longer prompts 14:18 - Findings on evals 17:25 - Every founder has become a forward-deployed engineer (FDE) 23:18 - Vertical AI agents are closing big deals with the FDE model 26:13 - The personalities of the different LLMs 27:26 - Lessons from rubrics 29:47 - Kaizen and the art of communication" | nitter](https://nitter.net/ycombinator/status/1928451506904400236#m)
