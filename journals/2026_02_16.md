	- >people with aphantasia may feel less fear when reading scary novels and could be less prone to the vivid flashbacks associated with post-traumatic stress disorder

	- >there is a lot of value to actively managing your agents' vibes and feelings, not just treating them as text-generation robots. The models aren't alive, but thinking of them as having feelings, rather than just next-token-prediction engines can help you nudge their mental states into a better place.

	- [Bo Wang (@BoWang87): "A Chinese hardware team just mass-democratized AI agents. They took a 430,000-line AI assistant that needs a $599 Mac Mini and 1GB of RAM — and rewrote it in Go so it runs on a $9.9 dev board with less than 10MB of memory. Boot time: from 500 seconds to 1 second. Cost: from $599 to $9.9. Memory: from 1GB to 10MB. Same features: code generation, web search, Discord/Telegram chat, memory system, scheduled tasks, security sandbox. The wildest part? They claim 95% of the new codebase was written by AI agents themselves. The humans just guided the architecture. It's an AI assistant that literally rebuilt itself to be smaller. Launched February 9th. Four days later: 7,400+ GitHub stars. This is the pattern no one's talking about enough. Every AI capability that starts expensive gets commoditized within months. GPT-4 level models went open source in 6 months. Now the hardware floor for running a personal AI agent just dropped 60x in weeks. The infrastructure moat in AI isn't sustainable. The only defensible advantage is what you do with these tools — not access to them." | nitter](https://nitter.net/BoWang87/status/2023222494312935523#m)
