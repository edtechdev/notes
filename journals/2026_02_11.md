	- >Assessing measures the learning a student demonstrates against defined outcomes; assuring is the academic judgement that this learning meets a passable standard for safe progression; and awarding is the institution’s act of conferring credit and qualifications on the advice of that judgement.
	- >The missed opportunity: shifting from “catching cheaters” to “confirming learning”
	- >redesign assessment so the reality is assurance of learning, not merely the appearance of control
	- >WSU’s approach is that we ‘start with stopping’: reducing unnecessary assessment volume and removing tasks that neither inspire nor assure learning.
	- >This old model confuses compliance with capability and marks with mastery. AI did not create that weakness; it revealed it.
