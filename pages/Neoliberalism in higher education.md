      - pedagogy should shift not only the way people think but also
        encourage them to shape the world in which they find themselves
        for the better.
      - [[Democratic education]]
        Education and pedagogy should provide the conditions for young
        people to think about keeping democracy alive and vibrant, not
        simply training students to be workers. Yes, we must educate
        young people with the skills they need to get jobs. But as
        educators we must also teach them to learn, as Zygmunt Bauman
        wrote in 2001, "to live with less or no misery \[and\] to fight
        against those social sources" that cause war, destruction of the
        environment, "inequality, unhappiness, and needless human
        suffering."
      - [[Learning as freedom]] critical
        education is about more than the search for truth, appropriating
        work skills and developing a broad and comprehensive form of
        literacy; it is also about the practice of freedom. Such a task
        suggests that critical pedagogy should shift not only the way
        people think but also encourage them to shape the world in which
        they find themselves for the better.

  -   - [[Tuition]] higher education needs to be
        viewed as a right and needs to be free, as it is in many
        countries such as Germany, France, Norway and Finland. When
        education is not free, it not only limits access to those who
        lack the wealth and resources to get into higher education, but
        also allows higher education to function as a
        [[sorting]] machine that largely reproduces
        social, racial and class hierarchies.

  -   - [[Open pedagogy]] A  [[critical     pedagogy]] needs to incorporate
        practices that enable students to become cultural producers both
        to expand their sense of [[agency]] and
        politics and their ability to shape the world in which they
        live.
