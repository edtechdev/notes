  Some cognitive/educational psychology areas of research that have been or can be used to justify sharing learning objectives with students are goal setting and advance organizers and scaffolding. Googling some of those terms with &quot;schema&quot; might result in some helpful resources. But like most things, the effects depend on the context.
  
  In the context and practice of sharing learning objectives/outcomes/targets in classes or course materials, the effects appear to be minimal/mixed if they are just passively presented. There are also arguments that they can have negative effects with respect to deep learning, critical thinking, and metacognition, and that they can induce a compliance mindset.
- The Purpose and Perception of Learning Objectives - no impact
- How Undergraduate Science Students Use Learning Objectives to Study - students like them, use them to narrow the focus of their studying
- Learning outcomes and critical thinking – good intentions in conflict
- Assessment as learning? How the use of explicit learning objectives, assessment criteria and feedback in post-secondary education and training can come to dominate learning
  
  So, it might be recommended that students do something with the learning objectives rather than just passively presenting them. Here are some resources on strategies for helping student actively process learning objectives:
- Optimizing the Efficacy of Learning Objectives through Pretests
- Have students practice grading/marking: Improving Students’ Learning by Developing their Understanding of Assessment Criteria and Processes
- Create an assignment or quiz in which students identify concepts or ideas related to each objective: APA Introductory Psychology Initiative (IPI) Integrative Themes Assignment
- Transparent assignments
- Have students create or respond to a mind map or concept map related to the objectives
- See also stuff on ungrading, specifications grading, etc.
