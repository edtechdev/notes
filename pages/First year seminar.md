Here's Angela Vaughan's research that includes recommending 3 credit
courses:https://www.unco.edu/university-101/student-achievement/program-research.aspxMore
info/data on her UNIV 101
course:https://www.unco.edu/university-101/student-achievement/

Bruce Tuckman's Learning and Motivation Strategies course at Ohio State
increased the graduation rate of low achieving students by
45%:https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1UZm-Jmwzz1MGViNTk2MzktNmY2Ny00ZWQxLWE1ZjktNzc5NzAzNzM0ZTdi/view?resourcekey=0-SyQ3K1rDqGqk1dXZZ8sdgg

This study found that a traditional 'extended orientation' course was
worse for first year retention than nothing at all. But students in a
'learning to learn' course had much higher retention than
both:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YqWUeprlyJd7lrhbQzqE8lUGnN8PfUe1/view?usp=sharing 

But here's a study that found no impact even with a 3 credit first year
seminar:Experimental evidence for a first-year experience course plus
mentoring on moderate-income university students’ engagement,
achievement, and persistence
