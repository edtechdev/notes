&quot;In technical paradigms of education—which critical pedagogues label “banking” models of education—the teacher is a director and the student actors follow the directives of the teacher in an attempt to create a final product. Technical paradigms are product-driven and the teacher plots the path that will lead the students to a desired outcome. Critical pedagogy challenges more technical paradigms of teaching and learning. Critical pedagogy, rooted in critical theory, is an education framework that approaches learning with an overt recognition of systemic societal hegemonies. Within critical pedagogy, the oppressed/oppressor dialectic is unveiled and students and teachers engage in dialogue and experiences with the intention of lifting the binary of “us/them” thinking and towards critical [[consciousness]].&quot;
