# Overview

As a parent, you should ask yourself, am I disciplining my child, or can
this be considered abusive punishment? Although in some cultures there
are bizarre ways of disciplining your child, there are ways of making
sure you are not abusing your child either.

Abusive punishment can be defined as an excessive use of force used on a
child for means of discipline. This excessive force can lead to physical
injuries with noticeable marks such as bruises, cuts, lifted skin,
burning, or if the child is in need of medical assistance. The actions
of abusive punishment can cause minors to feel long term trauma rather
than short term lessons which leads to habits of unhealthy parenting.

Abusive punishment can be when a child gets home from playing with
friends and is greeted with belt spankings from their parent because
they arrived home 30 minutes later than the parent expected them to.
This is no way to teach your kids life lessons. Parenting should be
about teaching your kids lessons and allowing them to put your lessons
to the test, not live in fear of their own guardians if they make
mistakes.
