### Improving Student Response Rates for Online End of Course Surveys

One difficulty with online end of course surveys is getting your
students to actually complete the survey.  Below are some tips for
improving response rates.

  - Encourage and remind students to complete the end of course
    evaluation multiple times.   Send out emails to students with the
    link to the online evaluation form, and remind them at the end of
    class to fill out the survey.  You can even show them on the
    projector screen how to complete the survey.  Add the evaluation
    dates to your syllabus and course calendar.
  - Emphasize to your students that the survey is completely anonymous,
    and that you will not see their responses until after the final
    grades are submitted.
  - Explain why the survey is important, and how you will use the data
    to make improvements to the course.  Tell them what kind of feedback
    you are looking for.  If you have any previous examples of changes
    you made in response to student feedback, you might share that with
    the students.  You can also tell students that the university
    assessment office and department chairs use the data, too, for
    example for promotion and tenure decisions.
  - To dramatically increase the percentage of students who complete the
    survey, give them time during class to do it. Ask students to bring
    laptops or smartphones to class and give them time during the last
    15 minutes of class to complete the survey.  It is best if you even
    leave the classroom during this time so that they feel more
    comfortable providing their responses, and again assure them that
    the survey is anonymous and you cannot see the responses until after
    the semester is over.
  - An alternative way to dramatically increase participation is to
    provide incentives or even credit for students to complete the
    survey, such as bonus points.  You should be careful not to design
    the incentive in a way that punishes students who choose not to
    complete the survey, however.

### Interpreting Student Evaluations of Teaching

You got your students to complete the survey, now what?  How do I
interpret their responses?  What use is this data?

  - It can be hard to read criticisms of your teaching, just as it is
    hard to read criticisms of your research papers, or to hear
    criticisms in general\!  Take it with a grain of salt.  If a student
    says something you think is mean or unfair, just let it go.  Every
    instructor receives negative feedback from time to time.  See also
    Cruel Student Comments: Seven Ways to Soothe the Sting.
  - Look for patterns in the responses, and patterns from semester to
    semester, not just single responses or numbers.  It is important to
    not over-interpret the numbers you receive.  Some people may
    mistakenly interpret a single course rating as “good” or “bad”
    teaching based on whether it is above or below some arbitrary value.
  - Teaching is very hard to do.  There aren’t silver bullets or recipes
    for perfect teaching.  Every class, every student, every day is
    different.  It can be difficult to interpret student feedback and
    use it to make improvements the next time you teach because of all
    these contextual factors.  However, some teaching issues and
    problems are more common than others.  Students bored with lectures?
    Not coming to class?  Not doing the reading? Unprepared? Cheating?
    See this Solve a Teaching Problem site from CMU for advice on
    dealing with common problems.
  - You can also meet with teaching & learning support for help with
    interpreting and addressing the feedback you received on your
    courses.  We can help put the students’ feedback in context, and
    recommend strategies for addressing any valid issues or concerns the
    students bring up.  We can observe and/or survey your students to
    further help you improve your course.

### Other General Frequently Asked Questions about Student Evaluations

  - Don’t higher student ratings just mean that the course was easier or
    grade inflated?  Or the instructor was more friendly or attractive?

  - There are some factors that influence student ratings that don’t
    relate to learning, or even negatively correlate with learning.  But
    that doesn’t mean student ratings and feedback are completely
    useless.  Student ratings correlate the most with *expected grade*
    rather than actual grade.  If a student comes into your course
    expecting an A but fails the first midterm or receives a C in the
    course, for example, they may punish you in their rating.  Thus, as
    suggested in the tips below, you need to manage their expectations
    from the beginning of the semester, as well as emphasize your own
    high expectations for their hard work and effort.  Think about why
    might they have the wrong expectations (calculus is different in
    college than in high school, for example), and consider meeting with
    students who are struggling in your course to discuss the issue and
    perhaps help them with effective time management and study skills.

  - Aren’t student comments often just whining?

  - Students might be blunt or upset in their comments at times, but
    that does not necessarily mean that there is no basis for their
    comments or that their feedback should be ignored. Try to translate
    student feedback into constructive changes and improvements in your
    teaching.

### Tips for Increasing Your Student Ratings

There are no silver bullets or magic formulas to good ratings, but here
are some strategies that have been shown to improve student ratings and
engagement.

  - Have teaching & learning support conduct a Midterm Student Feedback
    (MSF) survey with your students in the middle of the semester,
    rather than waiting until the end of the semester when it is too
    late to make any changes.  A staff member will visit and observe
    your class.  During the last 10-15 minutes of the class, the
    instructor leaves, and students fill out an anonymous three question
    survey.  The staff member emphasizes that this survey is completely
    anonymous and is being conducted at the request of the instructor –
    it is not about evaluating the instructor, but about getting
    feedback for improving the course.  The three questions basically
    ask students what has helped their learning in the course, what has
    hindered their learning, and what the students can do themselves to
    enhance their own learning (such as study groups, tutoring, using
    online resources).  The class as a whole discusses their answers –
    this helps students identify and add items they may agree with but
    did not think of themselves initially.  The staff member will later
    send you a summary of the students’ responses, along with
    recommendations for addressing any issues the students have raised.
     It is recommended that you thank or acknowledge the students for
    providing you with feedback that can be used to improve the course.
     Research studies have shown that this process is a win-win for
    everyone involved.  Instructors receive feedback from students and
    expert advice on how to improve their course.  Students in turn
    appreciate having a voice in the class and may respond with higher
    ratings on the end of course evaluation.
  - From the very beginning of the course, emphasize the course learning
    outcomes and set high expectations.  Student evaluation scores
    correlate with *expected- grade.  You have to be clear with students
    about the work and effort expected of them to succeed in the course,
    otherwise poor performance may be unexpected, and students will be
    more likely to respond negatively on course evaluations.
  - Connect your course to the real-world (contextualized learning).  Do
    your students know how the topics in your course apply to the real
    world?  Or are they given opportunities to apply their knowledge in
    real-world contexts, such as projects?  Do you talk about your own
    research or bring in outside researchers or show videos of
    professionals applying the knowledge learned in your course?  Or are
    you teaching the topic very abstractly with little or no real-world
    context.  Students will be much more engaged, motivated, and
    persistent if they know why the topics they are learning are
    important and how they apply to their own interests and to the
    real-world.  This in turn should positively influence student
    ratings of the course.

Meet with your students, especially when they are struggling or
low-performing, and increase the amount of student-faculty contact in
your course.
