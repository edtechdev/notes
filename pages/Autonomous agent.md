	- >Today, we mostly use LLMs in zero-shot mode, prompting a model to generate final output token by token without revising its work. This is akin to asking someone to compose an essay from start to finish, typing straight through with no backspacing allowed, and expecting a high-quality result. Despite the difficulty, LLMs do amazingly well at this task!
	- >With an agentic workflow, however, we can ask the LLM to iterate over a document many times. For example, it might take a sequence of steps such as:
	  Plan an outline.
	  Decide what, if any, web searches are needed to gather more information.
	  Write a first draft.
	  Read over the first draft to spot unjustified arguments or extraneous information.
	  Revise the draft taking into account any weaknesses spotted.
	  And so on.
