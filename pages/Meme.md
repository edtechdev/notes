Analogy - Memes can either be defined as a practice or belief through
which a society or culture evolves and that passes from one generation
to the next, or it can be as simple as something that makes you laugh
for a few seconds. Memes create a sense of development in your mind by
opening up your idea of a joke. A meme can either be a quick 4 second
video of a person running into a wall, or a picture of something that
might not be funny at the time, but certain scenarios will make you
think back upon that picture.

Example - The diagram shows a dog sitting in a burning house, saying,
"This is Fine." It might make you giggle at the moment, but nothing too
funny. So now in the future, let's say something at work is going
completely wrong and you don't know what to do, you would think back to
this because it would bring some laughter in the not so good day.

Plain English- In short, this will make you laugh when you want to cry,
memes will make your day more enjoyable even if it is the worst day of
your life.

This actually goes into detail as to why memes have advantages over
text, so it may be that because twitter is more text based, their ai
systems are better equipped to stop meme spread.
