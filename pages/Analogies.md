- [[fig:Memory.gif]] An analogy is similarities between two things that can be used to help learn a new concept or idea. Analogies help people remember a topic easier because it is something that person can relate to. Analogies are not any specific thing or idea it is different for everyone. For example, when learning about the solar system one person could relate it to the drawing of an atom with the center nucleus being the sun and the electrons being the planets, and another person could compare it to something completely different like a movie about space. Analogies are also similar to English topics like similes and metaphors. In both English topics a person is comparing something that is similar to another topic. Analogies can help people solve real world problems and open up their creativity to new extents. They can also be used for pretty much anything when learning a new topic, and is all based on how the learner views that new topic. Analogies can also help remember things. People can use analogies when studying and use a similar and more easy way to think about the topic they are studying for. In the psychology, analogies help with memory and developing active attention. The person wants to learn the topic and actively puts their attention to it. They do this be trying to remember it in a different way that is easier for that person. Analogies are a simply technique for encoding new data which is the process of taking new data and storing it in the brain. In other words analogies help the brain collect ideas easier.
