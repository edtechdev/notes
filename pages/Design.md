	- "universalist design principles and practices erase certain
	  groups of peopleâ€”specifically, those who are intersectionally
	  disadvantaged or multiply burdened under the matrix of
	  domination (white supremacist heteropatriarchy,
	  [[ableism]], capitalism, and settler
	  colonialism)... Design Justice goes beyond recent calls for
	  design for good, user-centered design, and employment diversity
	  in the technology and design professions; it connects design to
	  larger struggles for collective liberation and ecological
	  survival."
