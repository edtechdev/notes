Some things are too difficult or time consuming to accurately measure,
so we simply ask people to self report them.

Examples might include:

  - Use of technology
  - Diet and health habits
  - Thoughts, cognitive or physical exertion

We can collect these self reported measures via techniques such as:

  - [[Surveys]]
  - [[Think aloud protocols]] while they
    are doing some task
  - [[Focus groups]]

There are often going to be discrepancies between self reported and
actual measures, however
