Brief Explanation:	-  Our personality is the result of a variety of
things coming together to form something complex. Thought patterns,
responsibilities, personal relationships, attitude, genetics, biological
factors, and behavior all come together to make up our personalities.
The diagram is an example of the different things that come together to
make up personalities. Our personalities aren't ultimately final, it
changes and grows as we get older and move along in life. An individual
that usually has a big and bright personality might grow to become
bitter if life starts to overwhelm them. Personalities could also
change, depending on the environment. When we enter a new situation, we
gather the information around us and make decisions on what actions to
take and how we want to portray ourselves. At a party, maybe you want to
seem friendly and outgoing, so you try to socialize and participate in
some party games. At a job interview, you probably want to seem very
formal and respectful, so you sit up straight, stay focused, and speak
respectfully. There are also some theories that biological factors play
a part in making up our personalities, like how there are pathways in
our brain that are connected to the development of personalities.

Analogy:	-  Our personalities are similar to food. Different
ingredients will result in different dishes.

Plain English:	-  Our personalities result from our past experiences,
mindset, and current situation coming together to give us character.
