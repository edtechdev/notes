And one of *transfer- of mathematical reasoning resulting from metacognitive prompts to students to *&quot;self-explain&quot;- within an intelligent tutoring system (see the &quot;Not Enough Information&quot; items in section 3.2 and related transfer findings in the results section):

Our KLI framework paper has a discussion of kinds of &quot;*robust learning*&quot;, including transfer, long-term retention, and accelerated future learning and pointers to other relevant research:
