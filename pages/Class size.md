- **Class size and student success**

	- Based on review of literature, **author recommends class size under 30 students.

	- **“30 students may be a tipping point** where benefits of smaller online classes wear off.”
	- Students in STEM & upper division courses earned higher final grades
	  in courses with fewer than 30 students, compared to students in courses
	  with 31+ students.

	- “**The most important class size cut point is a class size of 27**, for both courses in the writing sequence” (p. 9).
	- “Students in small class sizes, less than 20, have a lower pass rate on 
	  the WPA [Writing Placement Assessment]. Classes between 20 and 30 have a
	  similar and desirably high pass rate on the WPA” (p. 10).

	- Of students surveyed, **student satisfaction was highest** (65% very or somewhat satisfied)
	  **in courses with 35 or fewer students** (p. 16).

	- Brigham Young University at Idaho’s face-to-face class cap is 50 and its average online class is 37
	- University of Massachusetts at Lowell has offered online courses for 20 years and caps undergraduate online classes at 27
	- **WCET Director of Policy & Analysis recommends 20 to 25** – “faculty members can teach online classes within this range without feeling overwhelmed”

	- Class size for optimal learning experience: “It depends”
	- Courses with fewer students participated more when instructor was active
	- “While research has established that class size does make a difference, 
	  the question of optimal size still needs more exploration.”
