  Mindset Works (https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/). A section of that site is devoted to Teacher Practices (https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/Teacher-Practices). . Psychology Today has a discussion on mindsets by psychologist Gary Klein (https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/seeing-what-others-dont/201605/mindsets). Mindset Kit website (https://www.mindsetkit.org/) J. Luke Wood's perspective that recommends we complement growth mindset with strategies for students of color Angela Duckworth's perspective that shares how grit and resilience play a role in developing a growth mindset Anindya Kundu's perspective that looks at learners' agency and how factors like socioeconomic status may affect development of grit and growth mindset An early, fairly non-technical research summary is, &quot;The self-worth theory of achievement motivation: findings and implications&quot;
