Have you ever fidgeted with an object while doing something like, watching television or listening to a lecture? Well it could be possible that you have an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. ADHD is all about how someones brain functions, people without ADHD have a brain that functions like a sedan that you use to drive around town while obeying all of the traffic laws. Sometimes there's even a GPS that tells you the exact way to go. However, people with ADHD have a brain that functions as a race car, but is still on the same roads as everyone else. The race car sometimes runs through stop signs or doesn't pay attention to the things around them. Most commonly in children, ADHD tends to be seen by brain activity and how someone with ADHD will have more immature, slow wave activity as shown in the diagram. This compares how someone without ADHD will have a mature and normal wave pattern throughout the brain. An example of ADHD would be when you are sitting in a class listening to the teacher's lecture, but you can't seem to focus on what they are saying. ADHD is a behavioral disorder where someone has a lack of attention or hyperactivity, which hurts their academic, social, and occupational functioning. The most common symptoms are fidgeting, having unfinished tasks, lack of focus, interrupting, emotional turmoil, etc. Many people believe that anyone who has ADHD just has a hard time focusing, but there is a lot more to ADHD than just that.
