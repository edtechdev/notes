[[fig:Autism_Brain.jpg]] Imagine having a disorder that many people think is hard to understand. Autism is not a physical condition that can be seen with your eyes. It is one that occurs in the brain, like depression, anxiety and other mental health issues and they all seem to have a stigma.

People have the perception that everyone who has autism is the same. The truth is that autism is a spectrum and people perception are wrong. Everyone person with autism is different. The spectrum is wide and people can display very mild sign while other can display very evident signs and behavior. For instance, one person affected by autism could be in [[AP course]] and only have difficulty reading social cues from their peers while another person may be non-verbal and violent toward anyone trying to interact with them.

Here is a snippet of what it is like to have autism. Imagine meeting a new person and you are already nervous and anxious. They start talking and you suddenly have an urgent thought that needs to be said so you cut them off. Then no matter how much you try, you just cannot look at the person in their eyes. Also, you have very narrow interests and cannot make conversations about other topics. This is a typical moment for a person who had autism. Usually, people with autism feel like they are alone and people hate them because they do not fit into the social norms or society.

Autism is a neurological condition that affects one ability to process and communicate information through societyâ€™s standards. People need to have an open mind about autism. Autism is a disorder that makes people think differently, but in the end, we are all human.
